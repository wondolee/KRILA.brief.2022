# A review of the regional economic resilience project of the Yoon government
+ 지역경제 활성화 타운의 실효성 제고를 위한 제언 (in Korean)

This working report demonstrates the effectiveness of the "Regional economic resilience centre project" as a part of the balanced regional development plans of the Yoon government. I have explored inequalities in transportation accessibility to motorway service areas, where to take out the role of transportation and regional economic hubs in South Korea. In order to foster economic resilience, I suggested implementing a Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform to deliver a seamless travel experience to the people who are willing to access areas of industrial parks or travel attractions over regions in South Korea.
