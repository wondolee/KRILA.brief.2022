# A review of regional economic resilience project links balanced regional development plan of Yoon's government.
## (지역경제 활성화 타운의 실효성 제고를 위한 제언)

This working report demonstrates the effectiveness of the "Regional economic resilience centre project" as a part of the balanced development plan of The Yoon government. I have explored the level of transportation accessibility to the (nearest) motorway service areas to take out the role of transportation hubs and regional economic centres. In short, I suggested implementing a Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform. It could help foster regional economic resilience to deliver a seamless travel experience to the people who are willing to access areas of industrial parks or travel attractions in regions of South Korea.
