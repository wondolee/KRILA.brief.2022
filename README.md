# A review of the regional economic resilience project of the Yoon government
+ 지역경제 활성화 타운의 실효성 제고를 위한 제언 (in Korean)

This working report demonstrates the effectiveness of "levelling up regional economic resilience" projects as a part of the balanced regional development plan of the Yoon government. I have explored inequalities in transportation accessibility to motorway service areas, whereas taking out the role of transportation and regional economic hubs in South Korea. In short, I suggested implementing a Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform, which is capable of providing improved travel experiences to the people who are willing to access areas of industrial parks or travel attractions over regions in South Korea.
